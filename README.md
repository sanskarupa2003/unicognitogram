## **Overview**

**Unicognitogram** is an innovative social platform tailored for university students. It provides a unique, anonymous space where students can express their thoughts, request accommodation (PGs and rooms), and stay updated on campus events. This project aims to address the gap in dedicated student social networks by providing a single, user-friendly platform for all student needs.

## **Problem Statement**

Many students use various social media platforms to share confessions, request PGs and rooms, or discuss campus-related topics. However, these platforms do not cater specifically to student communities, often leading to scattered information and lack of privacy. **Unicognitogram** solves this problem by offering a unified, anonymous platform dedicated to students.

## **Existing Solutions**

Several platforms provide similar functionalities but lack a focus on the student community or campus-specific features. Some existing solutions include:

- **Reddit**
- **Hood**
- **X (formerly Twitter)**
- **Threads (Meta)**

These platforms are great for general public use but do not cater specifically to the needs of university students.

## **Proposed Solution**

**Unicognitogram** aims to create a platform similar to Reddit or X but specifically focused on university campuses. Initially, we will launch for Lovely Professional University (LPU) and gradually expand to other campuses across India.

### **Key Features**

- **Anonymous Posting**: Users can share thoughts and confessions anonymously.
- **User Interaction**: Ability to like and reply to posts, encouraging engagement.
- **Campus-Specific Content**: Select and switch between different campuses to stay updated.
- **Duty Leaves Management**: Feature for managing and tracking duty leaves.
- **Events Section**: Stay informed about upcoming and ongoing events within the campus.

## **Roadmap**

This project is in its early stages. Future developments will include:

1. **Expanding to More Campuses**: Roll out the platform to more universities across India.
2. **New Features**: Adding interactive features like polls, private messaging, and more.
3. **Mobile Application**: Develop Android and iOS apps for better accessibility.
4. **Enhanced Moderation**: Implement advanced moderation tools for a safer community.
5. **University System Integration**: Integrate with university systems for smoother management of duty leaves and events.
